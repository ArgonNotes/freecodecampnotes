## FreeCodeCamp notes
This is a repository where [I](https://github.com/ArgonCode) keep notes I take while studying with [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com). The notes are generated using [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) and can be read online: [www.notes.argoncode.com/javascript](http://notes.argoncode.com/javascript).

Most of the notes are just a copy/paste from FCC. I will most likely add some info here and there when I learn things from other sources, but I will indicate it in some way. This is why the name of the repository was changed to javascript (note for the few people who were here before the name change).

I am doing it for two main reasons:

1. To be able to easily go back and find something. FCC is great but not perfect for that one purpose.
2. The notes are a copy/paste with small edits. I do not do them the first time I study the material. I go back to do that as an exercise.
3. Bonus reason: I :blue_heart: documentation. I am using this as an exercise in my future, hopefully rich, documentation endeavors.
